        <strong>Palpatine:</strong> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?<br>
        <b>Anakin:</b> No?<br>
        <strong>Palpatine:</strong> I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… <br>He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br>
        <b>Anakin:</b> He could actually save people from death?<br>
        <strong>Palpatine:</strong> The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.<br>
        <b>Anakin:</b> What happened to him?<br>
        <strong>Palpatine:</strong> He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <br>Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br><i>Ironic.</i> He could save others from death, but not himself.<br>
        <b>Anakin:</b> Is it possible to learn this power?<br>
        <strong>Palpatine:</strong> Not from a Jedi.
